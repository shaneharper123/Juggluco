<h1>Add connection</h1>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">Specify a connection
with another instance of Juggluco. Juggluco on one device sends via
IP/TCP data to a Juggluco on another device. To establish a
connection, one of the Juggluco\'s has to listen on a port and the
other has to make contact to that port. The port this instance of
Juggluco is listening on, was given in the previous screen (Left
middle menu-&gt;<a href="https://www.juggluco.nl/Jugglucohelp/connectionoverview.html">Mirror</a>).
Here you specify the port this instance of Juggluco contacts to if it
actively makes contact. If this instance of Juggluco can\'t listen on
a port, select &quot;<b>Active only</b>&quot;. If the other side
can\'t listen on a port, select &quot;<b>Passive only</b>&quot;,
otherwise leave &quot;<b>Both</b>&quot; checked. The Juggluco on the
other side should specify <i>Passive only </i>if you select here
<i>Active only</i> and <i>Active only</i> if you select here <i>Passive</i>
<i>only</i> and <i>Both</i> if you select here <i>Both</i>.</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">If this instance of
Juggluco actively makes contact, you should specify the IP(s) it
should contact with. If that host has multiple IPs, you specify more
than one; for example when two devices are sometimes connected via a
home network and sometimes directly as portable hotspot. 
</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in"><b>WARNING: Never
specify the IPs of multiple devices, in that case they will each
receive only part of the data. </b>
</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in"><b>hostname</b>:
Specify one hostname instead of IPs. This will make the connection
dependent on a nameserver thus slower and under influence of
disruption of the nameserver connection. This should only be turned
on in case you can’t get configure a static IP and the hostname is
automatically assigned to the dynamic IP.</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">In all cases except
\'Active only\', you can select \'<b>Detect</b>\'; in this case Juggluco
saves the first IP contacting Juggluco as the IP of the other side.
Verifying if the right device is making contact can in two ways:
Select \'<b>Test IP</b>\' to test the IP. If you select <b>Test Label</b>,
a contact is only established if both sides have specified the same
label.</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">Select <b>receive
from</b> if you want this app to function as mirror app. 
</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">If you want this
device to be the <b>sender</b> of data, you have to specify which
data to send.</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in"><b>Amounts</b>:
dose, food and sport data you have specified.</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in"><b>Scans</b>: data
received by scanning the sensor (scans and history under Libre2,
under Libre3 only data needed to access the sensor via Bluetooth).</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in"><b>Stream</b>: the
data received by Bluetooth. Under Libre3 this includes history data.</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">Sometimes some data
is already present on the receiving device. You can specify until
when this data is present:</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in"><i>Start: </i>no
data present</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in"><i>Now: </i>all data
present</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">Or a specific date
determined by the begin position of the screen.</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">When a data source
is added to an existing connection, the start date determined only
the added data source. For example if Scans and Streams were already
send to the host, and Amounts are now added, the start date only
determines the Amounts send. 
</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">In case two devices
are connected via an insecure connection, data can be signed and
encrypted by specifying the same (maximal) 16-character <b>password</b>
on both sides of the connection. Select <b>Save</b> to save what you
have specified. <b>Delete</b> will delete this connection
specification.</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">In the simplest
situation all connections belong to your home network, so you can use
local IPs. You can also connect over the internet via Wi-Fi, in that
case you should consult you modem manual on how to forward an
external port to an IP and port on you home network. 
</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">Two smartphones
connected via a mobile data connection over internet can directly
connect with each other, if one of them can listen on a network port.
If both can\'t (for example if neither has an individual IP), they can
still communicate with each other via a third device. One possibility
is to run Juggluco on an Android device (minimal Android 4.4) at home
connected to the internet via a modem. Another possibility is to run
a command line program belonging to Juggluco on a computer (e.g. your
PC or Amazon AWS):

<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">It is possible to
receive glucose values via Bluetooth on a device without NFC (see
<a href="https://www.juggluco.nl/Juggluco/mirror">https://www.juggluco.nl/Juggluco/mirror</a>):
Initialize the sensor via NFC on the NFC device and then send the
Scan and Stream data to the non-NFC device.Hereafter reverse the
connection for Stream date and turn off the Bluetooth connection in
the NFC device and on in the none-NFC device and also turn off
&quot;sensor via Bluetooth&quot; in the NFC-device and on in the
non-NFC device. So you can scan with one device and get glucose
values via Bluetooth on another device. But on all devices all sensor
data should be available. If devices exchange data, they always
should receive both scan and stream data. So you should always send
the Stream data back to the NFC device and the scan data back to the
non-NFC device. Otherwise, the data will get out of sync leading to
old authentication data being used or new data being overwritten with
old data.</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">The Amounts data is
totally independent.</p>
<h2 class="western">Network problems</h2>
<p>A strict complementary specification on both sides of the
connection is necessary. One simple omission can make data
transmission impossible.</p>
<p>It is possible that the connection hangs and has to be reset by
turning WIFI on or off or pressing Sync. Also, switching an
<i>activeonly-passiveonly</i> connection to <i>both</i> or the other
way around can make a difference.</p>
<p>You should also consider change of IPs with change of connection.
For example different IPs have to be used on the home network than
over a portable hotspot.</p>

highest. These values are only used when all the glucose values
displayed on the screen are within these bounds. Otherwise, the
bounds are widened so that all values are visible. When you take 3
mmol/L (54 mg/dL) and 9 mmol/L (162 mg/dL), and all the values on the
visible display are between 5 mmol/L and 6 mmol/L, the graph displays
a glucose axis from 3 to 9. 
</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in">If <b>Manually scale Glucose</b> is
turned on, you can change this: moving your finger over the top of
the screen, moves the top half of the graph up and down; moving over
the bottom of the screen moves the bottom half of the graph up and
down.</p>
<h2 class="western">Target range: low-high</h2>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in">The higher side of the display is
colored differently so you can see high values easier. The same is
true for low values. A red line is displayed to show the too low side
of the display.</p>
<h2 class="western">Glucose-axis numbers LEFT</h2>
<p>Place the numbers of the glucose level in the graph on the left of
the screen. Useful if you want to place your current glucose in the
middle of the screen, for example in Wear OS.</p>
<h2 class="western">Threshold</h2>
<p>Apply a threshold to the rate of change of glucose values. Only
when the rate of change diverges the specified amount from 0 is the
rate of change arrow different from horizontal. You can use arbitrary
values between 0 and 0.8. The threshold is used to prevent giving to
much meaning to small absolute rate of change values. It is very well
possible that the rate of change show a slowly rising glucose value,
but in reality it is falling. The threshold is used to make a more
cautious statement.</p>
<h2 class="western">Invert screen</h2>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in">Turn the display upside down. It is
switch on by default, because otherwise I did now and then
accidentally touch OK while scanning a sensor.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in">Some people ask for portrait mode, but
I have turned that off, because it is totally inappropriate for the
display of the glucose graph.</p>
<h2 class="western">Nfc sound</h2>
<p>Make sound during scanning in addition to vibration.</p>
<h2 class="western">Scanning starts app</h2>
<p>If checked this app will be started when you scan a sensor via NFC
even if this app is not displayed. If multiple apps have this
setting, android will display a chooser from which to select which
app you want to use. Somehow choosing one doesn\'t work and selecting
one to be chosen the next time neither. So in this case you can\'t
scan without an app in the foreground. Turning it off in this app,
will make it possible that at least one app can be activated this
way.</p>
<p>If you have root access, you can also disable NFC activation of
Abbott\'s Librelink app (doesn\'t work with Libre3):</p>
<p>Become root in adb shell or termux, and type:</p>
<p>pm disable
com.freestylelibre.app.nl/com.librelink.app.ui.common.NFCScanActivity</p>
<p>On Librelink 2.7.1 and lower you had to press:</p>
<p>pm disable
com.freestylelibre.app.nl/com.librelink.app.ui.common.ScanSensorActivity</p>
<p>com.freestylelibre.app.nl is here the Dutch version of Librelink,
this should be replaced with the version you are using. You can find
its name by typing (even without root):</p>
<p>pm list package freestylelibre</p>
<p>Afterwards, you can still use Librelink for scanning when it is in
the foreground, but it will not be started otherwise. Librelink 2.5.2
and higher crash themselves if they detect root. But in Magisk you
can easily hide root by renaming Magisk and adding individual apps to
the denylist (Magisk 24.3) or Magiskhide (Magisk 23.0). You should
also add Juggluco to the denylist. Except when you use US Freestyle
Libre 2 sensors, you can also use an older version of Librelink
without root check.</p>
<p>Without root, under adb shell, you can also disable the whole app:</p>
<p>pm disable-user --user 0 com.freestylelibre.app.nl</p>
<p>Before calling Abbott customer service, you can re-enable it with:</p>
<p>pm enable com.freestylelibre.app.nl</p>
<h2 class="western">Health Connect</h2>
<p>Send minutely glucose values to <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.healthdata">Health
Connect</a>. You can give other app access to these glucose values,
for example <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.fitness">Google
Fit</a>. Other apps again can get assess to data from Google Fit.</p>
<h2 class="western"><a href="https://www.juggluco.nl/Jugglucohelp/libreview.html">Libreview</a></h2>
<p>Connect with Libreview to send Freestyle Libre 2 and 3 glucose
values and amounts to Libreview and to get the account id used during
Freestyle Libre 3 sensor activation. Touch to change settings.</p>
<h2 class="western">Patched Libre</h2>
<p>Use the Patched Libre broadcast (originally send by the patched
German Librelink app 2.3.0), to send the Bluetooth glucose stream
data every minute to xDrip. In xDrip you need to set Libre2 (patched
App) as hardware data source. The glucose values displayed in xDrip
are different from the values it receives. For some reason xDrip only
updates its value every 5 minutes, probably because it was made for
devices that send only once per 5 minutes (A watch face connected to
xDrip regularly displayed more than 9 minute old values.) In
addition, xDrip displays its own interpretation of received glucose
values. Mirror devices can also sent to xDrip.</p>
<p>See <a href="https://github.com/jakobheyman/xdripJH">https://github.com/jakobheyman/xdripJH</a>
for an attempt to update the glucose value of xDrip every minute.</p>
<p>Freestyle Libre 3 sensors send missed values after a disconnection
period. These values are not sent with this broadcast. You will
receive them if you turn on the Web server in Juggluco and make xDrip
a Nightscout follower of Juggluco. Nightscout server:
http://127.0.0.1:17580</p>
<p>Juggluco can also directly contact with xDrip watch apps, so that
the watch app displays more recent glucose values. To use this
feature check <i>&quot;xDrip webserver&quot;</i> in the left menu
under <b>Watch</b>. See Help under left menu-&gt;<a href="https://www.juggluco.nl/Jugglucohelp/watchinfo.html">Watch</a>
for more information. Only one app can listen to the network port
used by the xDrip webserver, so you need to turn off &quot;<i>xDrip
webservice</i>&quot; in xDrip itself if you want to make use of the
one in Juggluco.</p>
<h2 class="western"><a name="eversense"></a>EverSense</h2>
<p>Yet another glucose broadcast. It can be used to send every minute
a glucose value to xDrip. xDrip will ignore nearly all of them
because of its insistence on one value in 5 minutes. You can remove
this restriction by editing the source code of xDrip. Change <i>4 *
60 * 1000</i> to <i>55 * 1000</i> in
<a href="https://github.com/NightscoutFoundation/xDrip/blob/645e8b4cb8fa3ad7b280f598d6f2f6bdb84ce392/app/src/main/java/com/eveningoutpost/dexdrip/models/BgReading.java#L969">app/src/main/java/com/eveningoutpost/dexdrip/models/BgReading.java</a>,
so that it becomes:</p>
<p>public static BgReading readingNearTimeStamp(long startTime)
{<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;long
margin = (55 * 1000);<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;return
readingNearTimeStamp(startTime, margin);<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;}</p>
<p>The advantage over the Patched Libre broadcast is, that xDrip
doesn’t transform the glucose values in some unspecified manner.</p>
<h2 class="western">xDrip broadcast</h2>
<p>Send the same broadcast as turned on in xDrip with
&quot;<i>Settings-&gt;Inter-app settings-&gt;Broadcast locally&quot;</i>.
Apps like AndroidAPS listen to it. Unlike the original xDrip
broadcast which was broadcast every 5 minutes, Juggluco broadcasts
this broadcast every minute.</p>
<h2 class="western">Glucodata broadcast</h2>
<p>A new broadcast that has the same function as the xDrip broadcast.
A simple example app that writes received glucose values to logcat
you can find here: <a href="https://www.juggluco.nl/Juggluco/glucosebroadcast.html">Glucose
broadcasts</a>. If you specify Juggluco as data-source in G-Watch,
you need to turn on this broadcast.</p>
<p>The application apps listening to this broadcast are shown. Check
the apps you want to send this broadcast to.</p>
<h2 class="western"><a href="https://www.juggluco.nl/Jugglucohelp/Nightscouthelp.html">Web
server</a></h2>
<p>Web server that can be used with xDrip watches and some Nightscout
apps. Previously called xDrip webserver.</p>
<h2 class="western">Insulin onboard (IOB)</h2>
<p>IOB is a measure of how much insulin remains from previous insulin
doses. To do this, you must enter insulin doses under a label in the
“<i>Rapid acting insulin</i>” category. You can specify what
labels are “<i>Rapid acting insulin</i>” under Left
menu→Settings→Web server→<a href="https://www.juggluco.nl/Jugglucohelp/setlibrenumtype.html">Give
Amounts</a>.</p>
<h2 class="western">Now clamp</h2>
<p>When “<i>Now clamp</i>” is set, the time period displayed on
the screen is scrolled to the left so that the present is always at
the same point of the screen. Some users run Juggluco on an Android
emulator on a computer at a few meter distance from them. When “<i>Now
clamp</i>” is turned off, the location of the current glucose value
would move to the right with the passage of time, so that after a few
hours it isn’t visible anymore. This makes it necessary to walk to
the computer and scroll the screen a few centimeter. When “<i>Now
clamp</i>” is turned on, this distraction is no longer required.</p>
<h2 class="western"><a href="https://www.juggluco.nl/Jugglucohelp/NightPost.html">Uploader</a></h2>
<p>Upload to a Nightscout server.</p>
<h2 class="western">Glucose notification</h2>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in">(Previously called &quot;<i>Glucose in
android status bar</i>&quot;). If set, glucose values streaming via
Bluetooth are quietly displayed in a notification and the android
status bar. If you turn it off, instead of a number, a dot is shown
and the notification tells nothing more than &quot;<i>To connect to
sensor</i>&quot; or &quot;<i>To exchange data</i>&quot;. An app that
stays running in the background, is obliged by Android to have such
visible notification (otherwise it is easily stopped by Android).
Juggluco only turns off the notification, when &quot;<i>Sensor via
Bluetooth</i>&quot; is turned off and there are no mirror
connections.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in">On some smartphones, the glucose value
is only shown in the Android status bar after changing Androids
notification settings. On Realme GT 5G for example, you have to go to
applist-&gt;Juggluco-&gt;manage notifications, tab on
glucoseNotification and turn off &quot;Set to Silent&quot;. &quot;Display
in status bar&quot; will now be shown turned on.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in">You can also get an android
notification by selecting <i>Notify</i> in the left middle menu. In
that case the notification will be sent to some smartwatches, if it
is configured that way. That works with Garmin watches, I don\'t know
if it works with anything else. Alarms also generate notifications.</p>
<h2 class="western"><a href="https://www.juggluco.nl/Jugglucohelp/floatingconfig.html" onclick="location.href=this.href+\'?unit=\'+unitstr;return false;">Floating
glucose</a></h2>
<p>When you turn this on, a small image with the current glucose
value is constantly present on the screen independent of which app is
in the foreground. If you turn it on the first time, you will be
directed to a list of apps in which you have to give Juggluco
permission to <b>display over other apps</b>.</p>
<h2 class="western">Sensor via Bluetooth</h2>
<p>Selects whether this app connects via Bluetooth with a Freestyle
libre 2 or 3 sensor. This is needed for alarms and continual glucose
monitoring.</p>
<h2 class="western"><a href="https://www.juggluco.nl/Jugglucohelp/alarmhelp.html">Alarms</a></h2>
<p>Set high en low glucose alarms, loss of signal alarm and value
available notification.</p>

labels</a></h2>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in">Specify the labels used for amounts. Go
to a screen to determine which labels to use to set amounts, like
insulin doses, carbohydrate consumption and hours spend playing
football. If you also use the Garmin watch app Kerfstok, these labels
are sent to the watch app.</p>
<h2 class="western">Language</h2>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in">Juggluco is displayed in the chosen

</ul>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">This watch app can
connect via Bluetooth with Juggluco to exchange amounts and
continually display your current glucose value.

The only way to keep these numbers, is to make a mirror and send it
back to Juggluco. Be careful because the mirror also is immediately
synced with its original. To function as a backup, all connection
with the original should be broken at some point in time. You can
also connect the watch to a device that is a mirror (left middle

<span lang="en-US">to receive alarm notifications on the watch.</span></p>
<h2 class="western">Watchdrip</h2>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">By switching this
on, Juggluco sends glucose values to <a href="https://bigdigital.home.blog/2022/06/16/watchdrip-a-new-application-for-xdrip-watch-integration">Watchdrip+</a>.
Watchdrip+ sends watch faces, showing glucose values, to
MiBand/Amazfit watches.</p>
<h2 class="western">GadgetBridge</h2>
<p><a href="https://gadgetbridge.org">GadgetBridge</a> makes it possible to display weather information on MiBand/Amazfit
watches. With the Gadgetbridge option turned on, will Juggluco send
glucose values to GadgetBridge under the pretext that it is weather
information. This had the advantage above Watchdrip that it is much
faster, but has the disadvantage that less information is displayed.
Juggluco puts the glucose value and a direction arrow in the location
of the weather. This location is displayed under Weather on the
watch. I haven\'t found any watch face that displayed this location.
Only for <b>mmol/L</b>: the value before the point is put in the
maximal temperature and the value after the point in the minimal
temperature. The values of <b>mg/dL</b> are too large for
temperatures, for that reason the last digit is put in minimal
temperature and the numbers before the last digit in the maximal
temperature. Thus 106 mg/dL becomes: maximal temperature 10, minimal
temperature 6.</p>
<p>The direction of change determines the weather icon: snow is
falling glucose, rain is rising glucose. It is also put in the
current temperature. Larger than zero means rising glucose, lower
than zero means falling glucose.</p>

<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in"><span lang="en-US">Juggluco
incorporates an xDrip/Nightscout</span> <span lang="en-US">webserver.
This makes it possible to directly use xDrip watch apps with
Juggluco. xDrip displays a new glucose value only every 5 minutes,
while Juggluco displays a new glucose value every minute. Juggluco
also sends to the xDrip watch apps the most recent glucose value. The
glucose values are only send to the watches if the watch app asks for
them, thus how old the displayed values are depends on when the watch
app asks for them. For example watch faces and data fields on Garmin
watches only ask for a glucose value every 5 minutes. Via xDrip this
often let to 10 minute old glucose values. When directly connected
with Juggluco, these watch faces show up to 6 minute old glucose
values. Under </span><span lang="en-US"><b>Garmin</b></span><span lang="en-US">,
if you can\'t use Kerfstok, you have the following options to
regularly receive a recent glucose value. An xDrip widget
(<a href="https://apps.garmin.com/en-US/apps/73115e04-dc9f-4765-ad88-e7ae283ce995">https://apps.garmin.com/en-US/apps/73115e04-dc9f-4765-ad88-e7ae283ce995</a>)
can also be used during the recording of an activity. So if you have
a hand free, you can switch to this xDrip widget while recording an
activity with a standard Garmin sport app. There is also an xDrip
sport app that updates its glucose value regularly:
<a href="https://apps.garmin.com/en-US/apps/aaf6533b-bca1-4365-9131-9f882f6f148c">https://apps.garmin.com/en-US/apps/aaf6533b-bca1-4365-9131-9f882f6f148c</a>.
You can try to start at a moment, so that it will request a glucose
values just after it is available. Data fields and watch faces would
be the ideal solution, but restrictions imposed by Garmin make them
of little value. </span>

<h1>Wear Os</h1>
<p><strong>Direct sensor-watch connection</strong>: This determines
whether the watch should be directly connected with the sensor. This
can only be changed when watch and phone are in sync. Use
Mirror-&gt;Sync and Reinit on phone and watch, to sync phone and
watch.</p>
<p><strong>Init watch app</strong>: This should be pressed once after
Juggluco is installed on the WearOS watch and is running.</p>
<p><strong>Defaults</strong>: This sets the connection settings to
its default values. This consists of the settings that can be changed
in Left menu-&gt;<a href="https://www.juggluco.nl/Jugglucohelp/connectionoverview.html">Mirror</a>
on the watch and left middle menu-&gt;Mirror on the phone. It
consists of settings like &quot;Active only&quot; and &quot;Scans\'.
This button can be pressed when the settings have changed
accidentally by water of the shower or during sleep. If you reset by
reinstalling the watch version or clearing data, then you also need
to remove the mirror connection on the phone.</p>
<p>A special version of Juggluco can run directly on a Wear Os watch.
It needs an Android smartphone with NFC to scan the sensor and via a
TCP connection this data is sent to the Wear OS watch. Hereafter
there are two possibilities:</p>
<ol>
	<li><p>The sensor stays connected with the smartphone and the
	smartphone sends every glucose value it receives via Bluetooth to
	the Wear OS watch via TCP;</p></li>
	<li><p>It is also possible to directly connect the sensor with the
	Wear OS watch. For this you need a Wear OS watch with good Bluetooth
	connectivity.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Some pictures are shown at <a href="https://www.juggluco.nl/JugglucoWearOS/index.html">https://www.juggluco.nl/JugglucoWearOS</a></p>
<p>To get it working do the following:</p>
<ul>
	<li><p>Ensure that both Bluetooth and WIFI are working on watch and
	phone;</p></li>
	<li><p>See that the watch has enough free storage space and RAM
	left. It is possible that Juggluco has to be reinstalled if the
	device runs out of storage space at a critical moment;</p></li>
	<li><p>Make the phone version of Juggluco working with the sensor.
	You have to scan the sensor a few times with &quot;Sensor via
	Bluetooth&quot; set. Receiving glucose values on the phone via
	Bluetooth is not necessary;</p></li>
	<li><p>Install the Wear OS version of Juggluco on your Wear Os watch
	and start it;</p></li>
	<li><p>On the phone go to left-menu-&gt;Watch-&gt;<a href="https://www.juggluco.nl/Jugglucohelp/wearosinfo.html">Wear
	Os Config</a>. Your watch should be displayed in the spinner. Press
	&quot;Init watch app&quot;;</p></li>
	<li><p>If everything went well, in both Juggluco\'s a TCP connection
	is configured and all data on the phone is sent to the watch. This
	can take a long time if you were using Juggluco for a long time. You
	can check if the TCP connection is configured by looking in the
	Mirror dialog (phone: left middle menu-&gt;<a href="https://www.juggluco.nl/Jugglucohelp/connectionoverview.html">Mirror</a>,
	watch: left-menu-&gt;Mirror). A connection with the same id as shown
	in the spinner for your watch should be shown. On the watch is
	should also contain the IP of the phone. If the are not there or the
	watch side doesn\'t contain an IP, press again on &quot;Init watch
	app&quot;. If it still isn\'t there, check the Bluetooth connection
	and the phone app responsible for the connection to your watch.
	(When the watch already has received data, pressing &quot;Init watch
	app&quot; has the effect of re-sending all, so you could as well
	re-install the watch version of Juggluco. Later on, if the right IP
	is not shown, you should on the phone turn the external connection
	(WIFI or Mobile data) off and on.</p></li>
	<li><p>If everything went well, the same data, as displayed on the
	phone version of Juggluco, is displayed on the watch version of
	Juggluco. Every new glucose value received by the phone is sent via
	TCP to the watch. Some settings like unit, glucose alarm levels and
	reminders are also transmitted to the watch. Later changes should be
	made on the watch itself.</p></li>
	<li><p>If you have a smartwatch with good Bluetooth connectivity and
	you like to receive glucose values on your watch without having to
	carry your phone, you can connect the watch version of Juggluco
	directly with the sensor. After all values are sent to the watch,
	you can check <strong>&quot;Direct sensor-watch connection&quot;</strong>.
	By this, <i>&quot;sensor via Bluetooth&quot;</i> is turned off in
	the phone and turned on in the watch. The stream values are now sent
	from watch to phone as you can check in the Mirror dialog. You can\'t
	change &quot;Direct sensor-watch connection&quot; when watch and
	phone are not in sync.</p></li>
	<li><p>If you want to sent amounts from the watch to the phone, you
	should reverse the send-direction yourself in the Mirror dialog by
	unchecking it on the phone and checking it on the watch. On the
	phone &quot;<i>Receive from</i>&quot; should also be set. If
	everything isn\'t set exactly right, it doesn\'t work. &quot;Don\'t
	change amounts&quot; should be changed. The labels of <i>amounts</i>are
	always sent with the amounts. If you change the direction of the
	transmission of amounts from watch to phone, you can\'t change the
	labels. It shouldn\'t be too easy;</p></li>
</ul>
<p>If the sensor has a direct Bluetooth connection with the watch and
it\'s values are sent to a smartphone, scanned values should also be
sent from the phone to the watch and the stream values should be
synced before scanning the sensor with Juggluco (the settings are
configured automatically this way.) Otherwise, old values could be
sent back to the watch or modified authentication information is not
sent to the watch, which will result in <i>Unlock key</i> errors.</p>
<p>Changes to the connection should also only be made when the data
is synchronized; the data on phone and watch should be complete
copies (with the exception that you can leave out allamount data).</p>
<p>The first time, when a lot of data has to be transferred from
smartphone to watch, you can attach the watch to the charger. My
watch turns on WIFI when it is attached to the charger.</p>
<h2 class="western"><strong>Watch-Phone connection</strong></h2>
<p>The watch-phone connection is an adaptation of the mirror
connection that you can configure between phones running Juggluco and
computers running <a href="https://www.juggluco.nl/Juggluco/cmdline">Juggluco
server</a>. When the connection between phone and watch is
automatically generated in the above described manner it has the
following additions:</p>
<ul>
	<li><p>The IP of the other side of the connection is automatically
	determined. Normally you don’t have to do anything directly with
	the mirror connection. Instead you can use Left menu→Watch→WearOS
	config to change settings. The exception is when you want to enter
	numbers on the watch. Then you have to change the mirror settings
	manually as described under <a href="#enteronwatch"><i>Enter on
	watch</i></a>.</p></li>
	<li><p>If the WIFI connection between the phone and the watch
	doesn’t work, Juggluco switches to the use of TCP over Bluetooth.
	Except when a lot of data has to be send to the watch on it’s
	first use, you can turn off WIFI on the watch.</p></li>
</ul>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in">When no data are exchanged between the

	watch and phone (WIFI can be turned off);</p></li>
	<li><p style="margin-bottom: 0in">The companion app of the watch
	should display that the watch is connected to the phone;</p></li>
	<li><p style="margin-bottom: 0in">In Left menu→Mirror on the watch

	watch (the same identifier as displayed in Left menu→Watch→”WearOS
	config” on the phone.)</p></li>
	<li><p style="margin-bottom: 0in">Pressing Reinit and/or sync in

<p>If you enter amounts of insulin, carbohydrate and activities on
the watch, you can’t do that anymore on the phone. Also scanning of
insulin pens is no longer possible.</p>
<p>There is currently no single button for this. On both sides of the
mirror connection between the watch and the companion phone, you have
to make changes in the mirror settings. First make sure that phone
and watch are in sync, then do the following:</p>
<h5 class="western">PHONE:</h5>
<p>Go to Left middle menu→Mirror. Press on the watch connection and
then on <i>Modify</i>. Unset <i>Amounts</i> and see that <i>Receive
from</i> is checked. Hereafter press “<i>Save</i>” and then
“<i>Close</i>”. Set “<i>Mirror sends amounts</i>”.</p>
<h5 class="western">WATCH:</h5>
<p>Go to Left menu→Mirror. Press on the watch connection and then
on Modify. Set “<i>Amounts</i>”. Set “<i>Now</i>” as the time
point until which all data is already present on the phone. Hereafter
press “<i>Save</i>” and then “<i>Close</i>”. Unset “<i>Mirror
sends amounts</i>”.</p>
<h2 class="western"><strong>Watch face</strong></h2>
<p>Juggluco for Wear OS includes a watch face that shows your current
glucose level besides the time and up to four complications. To make
use of it you have to select this watch face for example in your
watch companion app under &quot;downloaded&quot;. Normally you will
see the last glucose value when the screen wakes up. When the display
is in ambient (always on) mode, the glucose value is only updated
when the minute indicator is increased or you press a button or raise
your arm. So the displayed value can be up to one minute delayed.</p>
<p>There is also a complication that uses the Glucodata broadcast of
the WearOS version to display the glucose value in every watch face
that accepts the complication:
<a href="https://github.com/pachi81/GlucoDataHandler/releases">https://github.com/pachi81/GlucoDataHandler/releases</a></p>
<p>A third option in to turn on <i>Floating Glucose</i> in Juggluco\'s
settings on the watch. When Juggluco has the right permissions, a
glucose value is displayed over other apps. This way you can see your
current glucose value while using arbitrary watch faces or apps that
monitor your activity. For more information see, in the phone version
of Juggluco, left menu -&gt; Settings -&gt; <a href="https://www.juggluco.nl/Jugglucohelp/floatingconfig.html">Floating
glucose</a> -&gt; Help.</p>
<h2 class="western">Followers</h2>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in">From the companion app you can again
send to other devices over the internet as described under Left
middle menu→<a href="https://www.juggluco.nl/Jugglucohelp/connectionoverview.html">Mirror</a>.
It is also possible to connect the watch directly to a server on the
internet and from that to a follower phone as described at:

<h1>Libreview</h1>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">Juggluco can send
glucose data and amounts to Libreview. When using Libre 0 or 3
sensors, US/CA/AU Libre 2 sensors or other Libre 2 sensors with
<i>Bluetooth History</i> set, Juggluco sends the history values to
Libreview. If Libre 2 sensors are used without &quot;<i>Bluetooth
history</i>&quot;,Juggluco uses the stream data received via
Bluetooth to create these 15 minute points by averaging the stream
values around each point.</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">Like the Librelink
app, it sends data from the last 89 days to Libreview. 
</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in"><span lang="en-US">To
make use of this service, you need to create a Libreview account at
<a class="western" href="https://libreview.com/">https://libreview.com</a>
and specify its E-Mail address and password here.</span> <span lang="en-US">Don\'t
send data from the same period multiple times to the same Libreview
account (for example from the Librelink app and Juggluco). You can
delete existing devices in Libreview in Account Settings-&gt;My
devices or you can take a new Libreview account.</span></p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in"><span lang="en-US">To
turn it on, you also need to check &quot;</span><span lang="en-US"><i><b>Send
to libreview</b></i></span><span lang="en-US"><i>&quot;</i></span><span lang="en-US">.
</span>
</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">Juggluco will send
new data to Libreview every time you switch away from Juggluco when
it wasn\'t done in the previous 20 minutes. You can also manually send
it to Libreview by pressing <i>&quot;</i><i><b>Send now</b></i><i>&quot;</i>.</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">Beside glucose
values, amounts can also be sent to Libreview. For this you need to
touch &quot;<a class="western" href="https://www.juggluco.nl/Jugglucohelp/librenumhelp.html"><i><b>Send
amounts</b></i></a>&quot; and specify what each label means.</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in"><b>RU</b>: You need
to set this if you make use of <a class="western" href="https://libreview.ru/">https://libreview.<span style="text-decoration: none"><b>ru</b></span></a>
instead of <a class="western" href="https://libreview.com/">https://libreview.com</a>.
This only applies to Libre 2 sensors. Libre 3 sensors can only be
used with libreview.com, because no Russian Libre 3 app exists.</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in"><b>Immediate</b>:
Send glucose values to Libreview immediately when they arrive from
Libre 2 or 3 sensors. This is only useful in combination with
LibreLinkUp. To make use of it you need to add a LibrelinkUp
connection to this Libreview account in one of Abbott\'s Libre apps.
(If there is no Abbott Libre app in your country, you can use the
<a class="western" href="https://www.juggluco.nl/Juggluco/libre3/patched.html">patched
Libre 3 app</a>.) Sometimes the value is not immediately visible,
because display of <span style="font-weight: normal">LibreLinkUp</span>
isn\'t redrawn automatically. Using LibreLinkup is quite dangerous if
you don\'t look closely, because when you touch the graph, it shows an
old value instead of the current glucose value.</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in"><b>Spy Views</b>:
When this option is set, Juggluco will send to Libreview whether a
value is viewed or not. When this option is turned off, Juggluco will
always say that it is not viewed. This option will only reliably send
this information to Libreview when also <i>Immediate</i> is turned
on. Juggluco should be constantly connected to the internet to catch
all views from Libre 3, Libre 2 remembers them all as long as it is
not killed.</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in"><b>Change start</b>:
Start anew; resend data from a specified date and time. You need to
press this when switching to a new Libreview account.</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">Result of the last
time trying to send to Libreview is displayed below the &quot;Get
Account ID&quot; button.</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">Because the values
sent to Libreview are first transformed to one data point in every 15
minutes and then analyzed, there can be small differences between the
values shown in Juggluco\'s statistics screen and Libreview. For
example Libreview says 100% of the time active, while Juggluco\'s
statistics screen says 96.0%. Also some high and low values will be
averaged away, so that Libreview gives a somewhat higher <i>time in
target </i>than the statistics screen of Juggluco. Because the
history values created on the sensors are less extreme than the
average of the stream values around a history value, this difference
will be larger when Libreview is based on the <i>history</i> values
as when &quot;Bluetooth History&quot; is enabled in Juggluco or
Librelink is used.</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">Juggluco can be
connected with multiple sensors at the same time, while Librelink
only handles one sensor at a time. Juggluco also sends data from only
one sensor at a time to Libreview. It does this by first sending the
data from one sensor and only after no data is available from that
sensor, it sends the data from the following sensor. When Juggluco is
switched to a following sensor, Juggluco will not turn back to a
previous one, to imitate the one sensor policy of Librelink. This
means that when you run multiple sensors at a time and a later added
one ends earlier than an earlier added sensor, this earlier sensor
will send no data anymore to Libreview.</p>
<p><a class="western" href="https://www.juggluco.nl/Jugglucohelp/getaccountidhelp.html"><b>Get
Account ID</b></a>: If you only want to receive the LibreView account
ID, but not send data to Libreview, you can fill in your E-Mail
address and Password and press on &quot;<a class="western" href="https://www.juggluco.nl/Jugglucohelp/getaccountidhelp.html"><i>Get

Account ID will be shown (this can take some time and the screen is
not refreshed automatically). Retrieving the Account ID from the
LibreView server makes it possible to use a FreeStyle Libre 3 sensor
that was already used with Abbotts Libre 3 app with this LibreView
account.</p>

</p>
<p>For labels send as comments to Libreview the following restriction

<p>The same way as for Libreview, you
can also specify how to represent amounts via the Nightscout server
in Juggluco.</p>
<p>Select how the Amounts in Juggluco entered under a particular
label should be sent to Libreview. It is possible to send more than
one type of amount with the same Libreview label. For example if you
score Carbohydrate and pure Glucose food under separate labels in
Juggluco, you can specify for both that they should be sent as
<b>Carbohydrate</b> to Libreview.</p>
<p>For Carbohydrate, it is possible to <b>multiply</b> the amount
given in Juggluco with a certain number so that you can transform
other units into grams. If you count in Juggluco servings of 10 gram,
you can enter here 10, so that grams will be sent to Libreview.</p>
<p><b>Comments</b> means that the amount is sent to Libreview as if
you added comments in Librelink. If you specify comments here, the
Label plus the number entered for that label is sent. For example:
&quot;<i>Bike 50</i>&quot;, if you had a label &quot;<i>Bike</i>&quot;
and you entered &quot;<i>50</i>&quot; under that label. &quot;<i>Bike
50</i>&quot; will be shown under the graph of the &quot;<i>Daily log</i>&quot;

function (Left middle menu-&gt;<a href="https://www.juggluco.nl/Jugglucohelp/connectionoverview.html">Mirror</a>).</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">You need SSL for the
Android apps AAPS, Diabetes:M, <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=se.cornixit.nightwatch">Nightwatch</a>
and <a href="https://slingithub.github.io/CheckmateWeb">Checkmate</a>,
Sugarmate (MacOS and IOS) and <a href="https://github.com/JohanDegraeve/xdripswift">Xdrip4ios</a>,
Shuggah and Cockpit (IOS). Specify as Nightscout server URL:</p>
<p><i>https://hostname:port</i> 
</p>
<p><i>hostname</i> is the host name of the authenticated key you have
given to Juggluco, <i>port</i> is the port you forwarded to the port
you specified in this screen (default: 17581).</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">AAPS can be used
with Juggluco 7.3.0 and higher. For this you need to select

<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">Another phone can
connect to this server via a mirror connection or as Nightscout
follower (for example on an Iphone). If there is a Nightscout app
that doesn\'t work with this web server, please tell me. Maybe it can
be made to work with a few changes. (The IOS apps Nightscout and
Nightscout X are specific for one particular Nightscout server
program and will not work with Juggluco.)</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in"><b>api_secret</b>:
Specify that followers should set the ap<span style="font-weight: normal">i</span><b>_</b>secret
http header element to this value. This secret also works when the
followers use this secret as <a href="https://www.juggluco.nl/Juggluco/webserver.html#token">Nightscout
token</a> or use the api<b>-</b>secret header with an SHA1 encoded
secret. Starting with Juggluco 7.1.15 it is also possible to make the
api_secret the first element of the path of the Nightscout server
URL. If xyz is the api_secret and http://hostname:port is the
Nightscout server URL, you can specify http://hostname:port/xzy as
the Nightscout server URL.</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in"><strong>Visible</strong>:

Save modifications of Secret or Port.</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in"><strong>Use SSL</strong>:
use SSL (https). For SSL you need to give a Private key and Full

<h1>Upload to Nightscout server</h1>
<p>In most cases you can also use the <a href="https://www.juggluco.nl/Jugglucohelp/Nightscouthelp.html">web
server in Juggluco</a> or <a href="https://www.juggluco.nl/Juggluco/cmdline">juggluco-server</a>.
Only a few apps, that do nothing more than displaying the Nightscout
web page, need <a href="https://github.com/nightscout/cgm-remote-monitor">cgm-remote-monitor</a>.
You can even use AAPS and AAPSClient with the web server in Juggluco
7.4.1.</p>
<p>All stream values are uploaded to the Nightscout server at the
moment they arrive. When multiple sensor are used, all values of all
sensors are uploaded. Some Garmin watch apps/faces/widgets assume
that the values are space 5 minutes apart. When they receive glucose
values one minute apart, they will only show the last fifth of the
curve. For that reason, the webserver incorporated in Juggluco spaces
the values 5 minutes apart, except when &quot;interval=secs&quot; is
set to a lower value.</p>
<p><b>URL</b>: the url should be in the form of https://hostname:port
for example, https://myname.herokuapp.com:6789</p>
<p><b>Active</b>: Turn on uploader</p>
<p><b>test V3</b>: Let Juggluco use api/v3 to upload to Nightscout.
Don’t use it to upload to a Nightscout server that previously
received V1 uploads and don’t send V1 uploads to a Nightscout
server that previously received V3 uploads. At the place of the
api_secret you need to specify an <i>Access Token</i> with permission
to upload treatments and entries. You can create one in the
Nightscout web interface under Admin Tools.</p>
<p><b>Give Amounts</b>: Also send amounts as treatments to
Nightscout. Touching the checkbox brings you to a dialog in which you
can specify for every label what it means in Nightscout. These
specifications are shared with web server in Juggluco (<a href="https://www.juggluco.nl/Jugglucohelp/Nightscouthelp.html">Left
menu→Settings→Web server</a>). Only when all labels are handled,
can you check “<i>Give Amounts</i>”. If you later add a new
label, you have to remember yourself to specify what to do with it.
<span lang="en-US">Because of a bug in <a href="https://github.com/nightscout/cgm-remote-monitor">Nightscout</a>,
insertions at older time periods or deletions are only shown after
items with a new time are added. This means that it is better to send
less often to Nightscout. Now it is done every time the user switches
away from Juggluco by turning off the display or going to another
app.</span></p>
<p><b>Resend data</b>: Upload all data again to the Nightscout server</p>
<p><b>Send now</b>: Normally data is immediately send when it arrives
from the sensor or a mirror connection. Press on this button when for
some reason a previous attempt failed.</p>
<p>The WearOS version Juggluco 4.15.0 and later can also upload
glucose values to Nightscout. In nearly all cases you can better send
them via a Juggluco version on a phone or tablet or via Juggluco
server on a computer. It will drain the battery, especially when it
is unable to contact the Nightscout server, so you can better turn
<i>Active</i> off when there is no reliable connection.</p>

<h1>Notifications</h1>
<p>Unless Juggluco is used with Freestyle Libre 0 sensors, Juggluco
must remain active in the background to receive a glucose reading
every minute either directly from the sensor via Bluetooth or via a
network connection. To prevent apps from being killed by Android,
Android requires apps to display a notification so users know the
application is present in the background. The text “To connect with
sensor” or “To exchange data” describes why Juggluco has to
stay active in the background.</p>
<p>Juggluco also uses the notification to display the current glucose
value and a change direction arrow.</p>

<h1>Talk</h1>
<h2 class="western">Speak glucose</h2>
<p>Speaks glucose values when they arrive.</p>
<p><b>Seconds between</b>: Specifies how many seconds Juggluco should
wait before saying the next glucose value. Glucose values are always
spoken immediately when they arrive. When a large value is specified,
Juggluco will skip glucose values that arrive before this time period
has elapsed.</p>
<p><b>Voice</b>: Selects a speaker out of a list of possible
speakers.</p>
<p><b>Speed</b>: a higher number means faster talking.</p>
<p><b>Pitch</b>: a higher number means a higher pitch.</p>
<p><b>Test</b>: speaks out the last glucose value.</p>
<p>On some phones the Android settings for text-to-speech have to be
changed for it to work. Sometimes the data of a language has to be
installed or the configuration changed. On Samsung phones &quot;<i>Google
text-to-speech</i>&quot; has to be set instead of &quot;<i>Samsung
text-to-speech engine</i>&quot; in order to choose from different
voices. These options can be found by searching for <i>text-to-speech</i>
in Android settings or going to <i>Language and input
(-&gt;Advanced)-&gt;Text-to-Speech</i>. Here you can select &quot;<i>Speech
Services by Google</i>&quot; and install voice data. In other phones
it is under <i>System settings-&gt;Accessibility-&gt;Vision-&gt;Text-to-Speech
settings</i>.</p>
<h2 class="western">Talk touch</h2>

<h2 class="western">Speak messages</h2>
<p>Reads text messages, that are temporarily visible on the screen,
and the result of scanning (error messages and the glucose value).</p>
<h2 class="western">Speak Alarms</h2>
<p>Speaks out the glucose level during Low and High glucose alarms.
It is read both at the start of the alarm as at the moment the alarm
is stopped.</p>
